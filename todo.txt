* The States structure need a more complex way to indicate the seed since
there are cases where a seed might contribute two copies of that state or 
multiple seed contribute to the same state.

* Decide if overwriting is the correct way to deal with repeat elements. It
may be better to throw an error and make the user delete the old element
first.

* Some users are confused by the default compartment mechanism of adding
reactions. Maybe we should change it so that "no compartment" means "Find
any species with that name in any compartment and throw and error if more
than 1 is found."
